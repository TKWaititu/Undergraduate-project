    "# Simulating a health insurance claims dataset from KHHEUS survey data\n",
    "Our final-year university project focused on the profitability and sustainability of micro-health insurance in Kenya. Broadly, micro-insurance refers to insurance products that cover risks at lower premiums, often aimed at low-income earners. Since most insurance companies offering such products in the country were unwilling to provide the sensitive data we needed (aggregate claims, expenses, and premiums), my colleagues and I had to be creative. I came across data collected during the Kenya Household Health Expenditure and Utilization Survey (KHHEUS) conducted in 2018, available on the Kenya National Data Archive (KeNADA) website. I thought it would be interesting to use this data as the basis for simulating a dataset we could then use for our analysis. The process is outlined in this notebook."

    "Next, I chose to impute missing medical costs using averages based on illness and the type of  hospital service the patient recieved. For this to be justified, there needed to be significant changes in medical costs due to illness and service. Statistically, this is done through independence tests, which can either be parametric - those that assume the distribution (typically Normal) of the variable in question - or, non-parametric. QQ plots of medical costs suggested that the costs were not normally distributed, and so non-parametric methods were better suited. \n",

    "It was evident that some, about 48% of the surveyed households in the 'individuals_df' dataframe, did not have matching medical records. This could be due to errors during the process or, simply, because they did not have any hospital visits during the stipulated time periods. To create a realistic dataset for medical insurance—where a policy may not always result in claims over a given period—these 'zero' claims were needed. Therefore, I identified the missing households and incorporated their details with those that had medical records."

Because of this dependency, I chose to fit joint Kernel Density Estimates (KDEs) for each stratum, then sampled 11 times to generate annualized data for each individual. For example, if Household 1 contained 2 members and belonged to the 4th wealth quantile, I sampled 11 times from the KDE corresponding to the stratum (2.0, 4) to simulate medical costs and visits for the preceding 11 months. I then aggregated these simulated values with the observed data from the last month to estimate each household’s annual medical usage and expenditure.\n",

    "Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric method used to to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of a random variable. Given a set of observed values  X1 to Xn, a 'kernel' distribution (in this case I used the normal distribution) is centered at each data point (X value). The estimated probability density at any point y is then given by averaging the corresponding densities of the kernel distributions.\n",
